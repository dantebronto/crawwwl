From here you can click "Select image" (lightning bolt link) to being selecting images for each link. The image selected here is the one that will represent this link on your site. From this view, you can either select an image, upload your own, or mark the link as "bad" and it will never come up again.

h2. Posts

p. After you have gathered enough links to create a post, you can click the "Posts" link at the top of the page. Clicking add a post, will allow you to use known good links to create a post that will be visible from your website.
